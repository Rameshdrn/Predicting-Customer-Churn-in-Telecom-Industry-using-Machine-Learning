# Predicting-Customer-Churn-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Machine-Learning

**Project Overview**

Customer churn, the percentage of consumers who discontinue services with a provider, is a significant challenge in the telecommunications industry. This project's primary goal is to forecast and understand customer attrition, often referred to as "churn." Churn analysis is of utmost importance to telecom businesses seeking to reduce customer attrition and retain their customer base. In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to evaluate customer data, create predictive models, and identify customers at risk of churning.

**Dataset**

For this project, we leverage the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains valuable customer information, including demographics, account details, and service consumption history. With 7043 rows (representing customers) and 21 columns (features), the dataset provides a rich source of data that is well-suited to address our research question.

**Software and Platforms**

We utilized the following tools, software, and libraries in our project:

Programming Language: Python serves as our primary programming language.
Libraries: We harness the power of Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib for data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook is used for various stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
Version Control: GitHub plays a pivotal role in version control, collaboration, and sharing the project.

**Code Highlights**

The project involves a series of steps, including data loading, cleaning, exploration, and building machine learning models. Some key code highlights include:

Importing necessary libraries for data analysis.
Loading the Telco Customer Churn dataset and examining its structure.
Cleaning the data by handling duplicates, missing values, and data type conversions.
Visualizing key insights from the data, such as churn distribution by gender, payment method, contract, and more.
Implementing machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Evaluating model performance using various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

Feel free to explore the code for detailed insights and results.
